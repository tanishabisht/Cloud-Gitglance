## Existing Solutions
GitHub currently recommends repositories based on user activities like starring or following, supplemented by manual searches and built-in discovery features. However, these methods are typically time-consuming and may not accurately match user needs. GitGlance leverages advanced recommendation algorithms to offer more precise suggestions, improving upon existing solutions.


## Target Audience
The primary audience for GitGlance is students eager to engage with open-source projects that match their expertise and interests.
